To run the interpreter use the following command:
	java -jar interpreter.jar < filename.x.cod >

To run in debugger mode use the following command:
	java -jar interpreter.jar -d <filename>

I included the following files to use on the compiler:
	factorial.x, fib.x, and their corresponding .cod files
